This addon provides *standalone* functionality. The configuration addon enables storing and retrieving of persistent properties per user or project.

TIP: Every write operation in the Configuration object will automatically flush to the associated configuration file.

== Setup

This Addon requires the following installation steps.

=== Add configuration to pom.xml 

To use this addon, you must add it as a dependency in the *pom.xml* of your `forge-addon` classified artifact:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.forge.addon</groupId>
   <artifactId>configuration</artifactId>
   <classifier>forge-addon</classifier>
   <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Features

User-scoped Configuration ::
The Configuration object associated to a user is the default option when injected or retrieved from the `AddonRegistry`. 
It stores properties in a XML format in `<USER_HOME>/.forge/config.xml`.
+
[source,java]
----
@Inject private Configuration configuration;
configuration.setString("foo","value");
String foo = configuration.getString("foo");
// foo == "value" 
----
+
[TIP] 
====
If your addon uses a container that does not support "@Inject" annotations, services such as the `Configuration` may also be 
accessed via the `AddonRegistry`:

----
Imported<Configuration> imported = addonRegistry.getServices(Configuration.class);
Configuration configuration = imported.get();
----
==== 

Project-scoped Configuration:: 
   Project-scoped configuration is provided by accessing the `ConfigurationFacet` installed by default in any project. 
   It stores the properties in an XML format in a file named `.forge_settings` inside the project. It is important to note, however, that this file is only created if a configuration property is explicitly set for the first time.
+
[source,java]
----
Project project = ...
ConfigurationFacet facet = project.getFacet(ConfigurationFacet.class);
Configuration config = facet.getConfiguration();
----

TIP: Project-scoped configuration properties no longer falls back to the user-scoped configuration properties as in Forge 1.x.
